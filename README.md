The About page dives into the heart of what this project is about — “Life Under Water: The Hidden World Beneath the Waves.” Our oceans, seas, rivers, and lakes are home to an incredible variety of life — from tiny plankton to giant whales — and they’re essential to our survival. They produce oxygen, regulate the climate, and support millions of livelihoods.


Through Ocean Guardian, I’m shedding light on the most pressing dangers that threaten marine life:

🗑️ Pollution
	•	Plastic Waste: Millions of tons end up in oceans every year, harming marine animals.
	•	Chemical Runoff: Toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals pollute waters and destroy habitats.

🎣 Overfishing
	•	Fish Depletion: We’re catching more than the oceans can replenish.
	•	Bycatch: Countless non-target species suffer and die unnecessarily.

🌡️ Climate Change
	•	Warming Oceans: This disrupts habitats and forces species to migrate.
	•	Acidification: CO₂ is making our waters more acidic, which damages coral reefs and shell-forming species.
	•	Coral Bleaching: Vital ecosystems are dying off due to rising temperatures.



🌱 Why I Built This

I made this site not just as a project, but as a call to action. Ocean Guardian is here to educate, spread awareness, and hopefully inspire change. By understanding these issues, we can all play a role in protecting our planet’s most mysterious and essential ecosystems.
