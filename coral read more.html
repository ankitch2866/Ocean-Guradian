        <h1>The Vital Role of Coral Reefs and the Impact of Climate Change</h1>
        <article class="article">
            <img src="coralf.webp" alt="Coral Reef">
            <p>Coral reefs are vital marine ecosystems, often described as underwater rainforests due to their rich biodiversity. They provide essential habitat for countless marine species, protect coastlines from erosion, and support local economies through tourism and fishing. However, climate change poses significant threats to these ecosystems. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are causing coral bleaching and weakening reef structures, jeopardizing their health and the benefits they offer. Protecting coral reefs is crucial for maintaining marine biodiversity and coastal resilience.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Coral Reefs Are Important</h2>
            <p>Coral reefs are crucial to marine ecosystems for several reasons. They provide habitat and shelter for approximately 25% of all marine species, fostering a rich biodiversity that includes fish, invertebrates, and algae. Reefs act as natural barriers, protecting coastlines from erosion and reducing the impact of storm surges, which helps prevent coastal flooding and property damage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biodiversity Hotspots:</strong> Coral reefs are home to approximately 25% of all marine species, including fish, invertebrates, and algae. This high level of biodiversity supports complex and resilient ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Coastal Protection:</strong> Reefs act as natural barriers against coastal erosion and storm surges. By dissipating wave energy, they protect shorelines from damage and reduce the impact of natural disasters.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Value:</strong> Coral reefs contribute significantly to local economies through tourism and fishing. They attract millions of tourists each year and support fisheries that are vital for food security in many regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Medicinal Resources:</strong> Many marine organisms found in coral reefs have potential medicinal uses. Research on reef species has led to the development of treatments for various diseases, including cancer and arthritis.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Effects of Climate Change on Coral Reefs</h2>
            <p>Climate change poses severe threats to the health and sustainability of coral reefs. The primary impacts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coral Bleaching:</strong> Rising sea temperatures cause corals to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to bleaching. Without these algae, corals lose their color and vital energy sources, making them more susceptible to disease and mortality.</li>
                <li><strong>Ocean Acidification:</strong> Increased CO2 levels result in more acidic ocean conditions, which impair the ability of corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons. This weakens reef structures and hampers growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Storm Intensity:</strong> More frequent and severe storms can physically damage coral reefs, breaking apart their structures and disrupting marine habitats.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> As reefs degrade, the complex ecosystems they support also suffer. Many species rely on healthy reefs for shelter and food, leading to declines in marine biodiversity.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Protecting coral reefs requires urgent action to mitigate climate change and reduce human impacts. Efforts such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, implementing marine protected areas, and promoting sustainable tourism and fishing practices are crucial. By taking these steps, we can help preserve the vital functions of coral reefs and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>
