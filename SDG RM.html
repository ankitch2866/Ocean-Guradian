                <h1>Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water</h1>
                <p>Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) is dedicated to conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources. This goal is vital because oceans cover over 70% of the planetâ€™s surface, providing essential resources and services to humanity and the entire ecosystem. Here are the key targets and initiatives under SDG 14:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reduce Marine Pollution (Target 14.1)</strong><br>
                        Objective: By 2025, significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, particularly from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.<br>
                        Actions: Implement waste management practices, reduce plastic waste, and prevent pollutants from entering the ocean.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Protect and Restore Ecosystems (Target 14.2)</strong><br>
                        Objective: By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts by strengthening their resilience and taking action for their restoration.<br>
                        Actions: Protect habitats like coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrasses.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize Ocean Acidification (Target 14.3)</strong><br>
                        Objective: Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels.<br>
                        Actions: Monitor ocean pH levels and support research to mitigate acidification effects on marine life.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainable Fishing (Target 14.4)</strong><br>
                        Objective: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting, end overfishing, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and destructive fishing practices, and implement science-based management plans to restore fish stocks.<br>
                        Actions: Promote sustainable fishing practices and reduce bycatch.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Conserve Coastal and Marine Areas (Target 14.5)</strong><br>
                        Objective: By 2020, conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.<br>
                        Actions: Establish and manage Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to safeguard biodiversity.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>End Subsidies Contributing to Overfishing (Target 14.6)</strong><br>
                        Objective: By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to IUU fishing, and refrain from introducing new such subsidies.<br>
                        Actions: Reduce harmful subsidies and promote transparency in fisheries subsidies.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Increase Economic Benefits from Sustainable Use of Marine Resources (Target 14.7)</strong><br>
                        Objective: By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism.<br>
                        Actions: Support sustainable economic activities and enhance livelihoods of coastal communities.
